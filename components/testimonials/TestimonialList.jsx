    review:
      "Monique is, hands down, one of the best developers I’ve had the pleasure of working with. Watching her evolve from someone just starting out into a powerhouse of a developer has been amazing. She has an unmatched drive to learn and a determination that pushes her to take on challenges others might avoid. What truly sets Monique apart, though, is her attitude—she’s not just about getting things done; she brings a spark to every project and every team. As a leader, she balances guidance with support, always making sure everyone feels heard. On a personal level, she’s the kind of person who celebrates every little win and always has a creative, bold idea ready to go. Working with her is not only productive, it’s genuinely fun.",
